# Horiseon web development

This project is to refactor an existing website for horiseon development for search engine optimisation and accessibility.

I think one of the biggest improvements for SEO will be adding the title to the page so it's more relevant to search engines.

I've tried using bootstrap to make the page responsive for different devices and browsers but am new to bootstrap so have struggled with relative sizes and trying to get the page to shrink correctly

I've used alt tags for images, and semantic html tags to try and make sure the page is as accessible as possible

to help me develop the page i've used the resources below. the IDE i used was vs code
